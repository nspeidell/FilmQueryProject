# FilmQueryProject

# Description
    The film query app gives a user the ability to search the database for two different options.  
    The first is to pick a film by its film id.  The app will then return the film with a title, description, 
    release date, rating, language it is filmed in, and the list of actors that played in the film matching the film id.  
    The second option is to search by keyword.  The search will look for the keyword in either 
    the film title or the film description.  The search will return a list of films that match the keyword
    and all the same results as the first search.  Finally the use can continue new saerches until they decide to quit.

# Lessons Learned
   This project introduced database query's and with any new technology I had to work through the terminology and format.
   I had a joined table causing problems that I had a hard time fixing because I'm so used to troubleshooting Java.  
   I had to stop and think to work through the query.  I had a bit of difficulty getting the actors into the results, 
   but after over thinking and some assistance I realized I could just call them in the method.
